# tdr-data-retention-reviewer
This repository contains code for a scripted process that reviews published and unpublished datasets in a Dataverse instance and produces reports which identify datasets to be considered for deaccessioning.

It has been developed to specifically support data retention decision making in the Texas Data Repository (https://dataverse.tdl.org/) but designed to be adaptable for other Dataverse installations.
